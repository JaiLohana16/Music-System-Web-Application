# Music System Web Application
This is a simple music system web application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project categorizes songs into different genres: Love, Dance, Punjabi, Devotional, and Happy.

# Features:
Two versions of scripts:
script2.js: A simpler version with basic functionality, storing all songs in a single folder.
Main script: More advanced, organizing songs into subfolders for each genre.

# Song Management: Songs can be fetched and played from different categories with a smooth user interface.
# Deployment Setup: For deployment on freewebhostmost.com (with 125MB free space), the song folder structure and fetching method need to be adjusted slightly.
#Demo:
